Net::Stremload - a Perl module to access the Stremload.com server

You can install this package with the standard procedure for installing
Perl modules:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (Does nothing at the moment...)
    make install

You should do this as 'root'. This also installs the command line tool 'slup'
to demonstrate the functions of the module. Oh yes, if you only want to upload
files to Streamload, you can use this program ;-) It is a full working upload
program and uses every detail of the module. Just call is with 'slup' and it
will show you its usage. Have  a lot of fun with Streamload!
