Net::Streamload - a Perl module to access the Streamload.com server

Included is a simple command line tool named 'slup' to demonstrate the
functions of the module. Oh yes, if you only want to upload files to
Streamload, you can use this program ;-) It is a full working upload program
and uses every detail of the module. Just call is with 'slup' and it will show
you its usage. Have a lot of fun with Streamload!

You can get the most recent version of this module from your nearest CPAN
mirror. To automagically get to the nearest CPAN mirror, use the URL
http://www.perl.com/CPAN.

For bleeding-edge-development see my CVS start page at http://fli4l.mooo.com/.

If you like this module, why not use it to upload a nice file to my Streamload
account? You can upload to the account 'TobiX'.
