You can install this package with the standard procedure for installing
Perl modules (built with ExtUtils::MakeMaker):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (Does nothing at the moment...)
    make install

You should do the last step as 'root'.

Windows:

I recommend the use of ActiveState Perl, it's really easy with this:
  1) Download ActiveState Perl from
        http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Get.plex?id=ActivePerl
     You don't need to register, just press "Next"
  2) Get nmake from Microsoft:
        ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe
  3) Install the module with the following commands:
        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test (Yes, you can skip this...)
        nmake install
  4) Everything is fine!
